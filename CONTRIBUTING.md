# How to Contribute To This Repository

## Format:

you have various possibilities:

1. add  a markdown (.md) file (to create a markdown file, create a .txt file and then change the file extension to .md) 
to the folder [docs](https://github.com/Encode-guidelines/guidelines/tree/gh-pages/docs)

[Here:](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) you'll find instructions on how to write in markdown in GitHub.

NB: section titles that we want to appear in the Table of Content of the webpage

Remember that changes may take up to 10 minutes to show up in the [online version of the Guidelines](https://encode-guidelines.github.io/guidelines/)

2. edit a .md file already present in the folder [docs](https://github.com/Encode-guidelines/guidelines/tree/gh-pages/docs)

please, do not change anything between the two "---" on the top of the page, as it would result in changes/errors in the [Guidelines website](https://encode-guidelines.github.io/guidelines/).

Again: remember that changes may take up to 10 minutes to show up in the [online version of the Guidelines](https://encode-guidelines.github.io/guidelines/)
 
3. if you wish to write with Microsoft Word, you can afterwards convert it to Markdown using the Pandoc software https://pandoc.org/. 
NB!: Pandoc does not have a graphic interface, so you will have to use Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt on Windows, but the Pandoc website guides you nicely through [all the necessary steps](https://pandoc.org/getting-started.html)

4. you can also put Word documents in the [ENCODE common drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zrehnzzbwKl4cjvHnlZ1MhNbF_Xt4Ym7) and then it will be converted by the current editor of the Guidelines.


The ENCODE guidelines are conceived as a companion resource to the ENCODE open online course,
published ond DARIAH teach, and to the ENCODE Database. They are conceived as a more dynamic and updated reference resource,
presenting a more systematic list of resources for digital methodes in the study of ancient writing cultures and for the learning and teaching of them.
The educational focus is the distinctive character of this resource, as it was of the [ENCODE project][encode], which constitutes their background.
Resources are here presented which teachers and learners approaching digital methodes in the study of ancient writing cultures should become familiar with or, 
at the very least, know the existence of.
