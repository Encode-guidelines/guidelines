to the folder [docs](https://github.com/Encode-guidelines/guidelines/tree/gh-pages/docs)

here you find instruction on how to
[write in markdown for GitHub:](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Remember that changes may take up to 10 minutes to show up in the [online version of the Guidelines](https://encode-guidelines.github.io/guidelines/)

The ENCODE guidelines are conceived as a companion resource to the ENCODE open online course,
published ond DARIAH teach, and to the ENCODE Database. They are conceived as a more dynamic and updated reference resource,
presenting a more systematic list of resources for digital methodes in the study of ancient writing cultures and for the learning and teaching of them.
The educational focus is the distinctive character of this resource, as it was of the [ENCODE project][encode], which constitutes their background.
Resources are here presented which teachers and learners approaching digital methodes in the study of ancient writing cultures should become familiar with or,
