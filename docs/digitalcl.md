The [<u>Digital Classicist</u>](https://www.digitalclassicist.org/) is
an international community of scholars interested in the application of
innovative digital methods and technologies to research on the heritage
of the ancient and historical worlds. The community was created in 2005
and the main website is hosted by the King’s College London.

Among the tools offered by the Digital Classicist Community are
[<u>seminars</u>](https://www.digitalclassicist.org/wip/index.html)
about digital tools and projects dealing with the study of the ancient
world, organised since 2006 and hosted by several institutions
(Institute for Classical Studies at the University of London, various
institutions in Berlin, the University of Leipzig and the Tufts
University in Boston). The results of these seminars have often found
publication in peer-reviewed volumes and articles, many of them in open
access. Another tool offered by the community is the [<u>Discussion
list</u>](https://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/Digital_Classicist_Discussion_List)
(hosted by JISCmail), in which members can discuss different aspects of
Digital Humanities applied to the study of the ancient world and
cultural heritage and share news about events, publications and job
announcements. The Digital Classicist Community has also a blog, the
[<u>Stoa Review</u>](https://blog.stoa.org/), which publishes after a
process of peer-review news, reviews, opinions and discussions of
classical and digital matters.

The most important tool is the [<u>Digital Classicist
Wiki</u>](https://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/Main_Page), a catalogue of
digital tools, projects and other resources for the study of the ancient
world. An important section of the wiki is the FAQ section for technical
questions of interest to classicists and archaeologists. The Wiki is
collaboratively edited by the community, which has a small board of
administrators and several editors listed in a specific section: more
and more users collaborate in implementing this instrument also thanks
to the training events regularly organised on how to edit wiki pages.

The Digital Classicist Wiki has several pages but three different kinds
can be recognized: pages about projects, research centres and digital
tools. Each page is structured as follows: at the beginning of the page
there is the link to the external resource, then a prose description
(sometimes a quote from the project’s main website) depending on the
type of resource described (a project, a research centre or a tool),
thereafter information about the principal investigators and project’s
collaborators (if applicable). At the end of the page are categories,
which are content labels applied by editors to each page to make it more
easily searchable. Pages are listed in alphabetical order and can be
searched: on the left of the page there is a textual search mask or a
menu Navigation: clicking on Categories, there is the possibility to
search for categories and to have displayed all the pages labelled with
the same category. The Digital Classicist Wiki is not only useful to
keep the community up-to-date on recent projects and digital resources
but also to keep track of projects which are expired and which can be
found under the category ‘Legacy’ (this allows the user also to reflect
on the issues of sustainability of digital resources).

Static web pages do not take into account the large number of people
active in the community and at the same time the speed with which
digital resources change and update. The format of the wiki, open access
and easily modifiable by a large number of users allows the Digital
Classicist Community to quickly interact and implement this resource,
guaranteeing at the same time the openness of the resource, the speed of
the updating and the possibility of keeping track of these constant
changes. In fact, everyone can ask the administrators for an account and
edit the wiki. The quality of the content is monitored by the board and
changes to the pages are visible to all by clicking on the ‘View
History’ link at the right top of each page.
