[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) is a non-profit organization with the aim of building global capacity in essential data and 
computational skills for people conducting and supporting research, so that research can be efficient, open, and reproducible. It is 
an open and inclusive community of learners and instructors "that promotes and models the importance of software and data in research". 

Lessons, including teaching material and exercises (with solutions) are developed collaboratively, using evidence-based teaching practices, 
and are made [freely available online](https://carpentries.org/workshops-curricula/). 

Lessons are organized in different [curricula](https://carpentries.org/workshops-curricula/)
and curricula are grouped under three main categories:

[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)

[Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/)

[Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/)

A wide variety of lessons still in the testing phase or under development can be found in 
the [Carpentries Incubator](https://carpentries-incubator.org/)
