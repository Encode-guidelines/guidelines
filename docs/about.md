The ENCODE guidelines are conceived as a companion resource to the ENCODE open online course, published ond DARIAH teach, and to the ENCODE Database. They are conceived as a more dynamic and updated reference resource, presenting a more systematic list of resources for digital methodes in the study of ancient writing cultures and for the learning and teaching of them. The educational focus is the distinctive character of this resource, as it was of the [ENCODE project](https://site.unibo.it/encode/en), which constitutes their background.
Resources are here presented which teachers and learners approaching digital methodes in the study of ancient writing cultures should become familiar with or, at the very least, know the existence of. 

Resources have been divided in the following sections:

### Introduction
On the ENCODE database and its pedagogical frame

### Corpus and database creation
Resources are listed which are useful to create, work with, store, publish and disseminate databases (with particular regard for the creation of textual corpora of ancient languages).

### Best practices
Links to guidelines, user manuals and best practices summaries.

### Courses
Resources offering open access lessons and courses about relevant themes.

### Portals and mailing lists

### Bibliographies

### Terminology
A list of relevant terms and concepts (either present in the ENCODE Mooc or relevant in general), with short and simple definitions.
