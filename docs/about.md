## About
The ENCODE guidelines are conceived as a companion reference resource to the
 [ENCODE Online Course](https://teach-dariah-cur.acdh-dev.oeaw.ac.at/course/view.php?id=73),
published on the DARIAH teach platoform, and to the [ENCODE Database](https://gn.biblhertz.it/encode/). 
The distinctive character of this resource is the educational focus, as it has generally been of the 
[ENCODE project](https://site.unibo.it/encode/en), from which they originate. 

The ENCODE guidelines aim at being an agile reference resource, a guide, for  teachers and learners, to orientate theirselves
 in the landscape of digital resources and methods for the the study of ancient writing cultures, a guide which can be used to to find out  
where to start, what and where to learn, and if there are already established communities they can join 
and best practices and guidelines they can follow.

## Structure of the ENCODE guidelines  
After an [introductory section](/introduction), which contains a description of the [ENCODE database](/database) 
and its [pedagogical frame](/competences), resources have been divided in the following sections:

-  [Corpus and database creation](/db_creation) 
resources are listed which are useful to create, work with, store, publish and disseminate databases 
(with particular regard for the creation of textual corpora of ancient languages).

- [Best practices](/epidoc)    
Links to guidelines, user manuals and best practices summaries.

- [Courses](/soft_carp)  
Resources offering open access lessons and courses about relevant themes.

- [Portals and mailing lists](/mailing_lists)  
A list of portals and mailing list useful for teachers, students and researchers in the field of ancient writing cultures.

- [Bibliographies](/bibliographies)  
A list bibliographical sites and databases useful for teachers, students and researchers in the field of ancient writing cultures.

- [Terminology](/terminology)   
A list of relevant terms and concepts (either present in the ENCODE Mooc or relevant in general), with short and simple definitions.
