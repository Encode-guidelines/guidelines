/PROBLEMS, PEOPLE, PLACES.**

-   Know the use of ancient documents as historical sources; define and
    describe the different types of texts in relation with the support
    and identify relevant research areas/problems they may contribute.

-   Know how to find relevant information for interpreting ancient
    documents and relating them to the main problems and themes of
    epigraphy and /or papyrology (or other specific disciplines).

**2.2 SOURCE RETRIEVAL - METADATA CATALOGUING PRACTICES:**

-   Can read a lemma and understand catalogue information about origin,
    provenance, editions, analysis of material support, present
    location of documents.

-   Can retrieve editions, origin, provenance, conservation history
    through the main paper-based and digital corpora, reference tools
    and digital infrastructures related to Greek and Roman epigraphy
    and papyrology and /or other ancient documents related sciences.

-   Can use independently and critically inventories, catalogues,
    electronic resources to locate and evaluate needed data and source
    material and organise them to address research problems.

**2.3 SOURCE ANALYSIS - TRANSCRIPTION, CRITICAL EDITION, AND
INTERPRETATION:**

-   Know and are able to apply linguistic, paleographical and editorial
    skills to date, decipher transcribe and edit a document.

-   Can apply source critique to a group of sources according to the
    concept of ancient archive, dossier and can locate meaningful
    parallels for interpreting different problems.

-   Can analyse different aspects of an original inscription or papyrus
    and identify the relevance of the document for specific research
    questions.

**2.4 CONTEXTUALIZATION OF SOURCE PRODUCTION AND TRANSMISSION –
PRESERVATION HISTORY / HISTORICAL CONTEXT:**

-   Can understand and identify the different contexts (institutional,
    archaeological, museological etc.) that may have determined the
    formation and preservation of the ancient documents.

-   Can handle metadata with relevant information about the history of
    the document including context of production and history of
    finding and preservation;.

-   Can organise data about the different contexts (institutional,
    archaeological, museological etc.) which have determined the
    formation and preservation of the Greek and Roman inscriptions and
    papyri (and /or other kinds of ancient documents) and use them
    towards a research project.

**DIMENSION 4: INTERDISCIPLINARITY**

-   Can understand relations among different fields of study (epigraphy,
    philology, archaeology, linguistics), methods and tools of the
    digital domain.

-   Can approach problems from different points of view.

-   Are aware of methods of different areas of research with ancient
    documents and of critical and methodological skills involved
    (philology, linguistics, history, archaeology).

-   Can utilise the information obtained using different method(s) from
