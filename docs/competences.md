## The ENCODE competences

Training materials have been collected and organised on the basis of a
definition of competences and learning outcomes aligned to international
reference frameworks. The competences’ choice has been developed in
consultation with stakeholders who have designed or have participated in
training events aimed at providing innovative digital competences to
graduates and scholars specialised in the study of ancient written
documents.

The result of the consultation is available in two reports published on
the ENCODE website:
[https://site.unibo.it/encode/en/outputs](https://site.unibo.it/encode/en/outputs):
the first, by Birgit Breuer, *Report on digital competences, learning
outcomes and best practices in teaching and learning* has focused mainly
on the trainer perspective, while the second, by Marta Fogagnolo, *Hands
on workshops. ENCODE report on digital competences, learning outcomes
and best practices in teaching and learning* (published as well at: DOI:
[10.6092/unibo/amsacta/7046](http://doi.org/10.6092/unibo/amsacta/7046))
has focused mostly on the trainee perspective, starting from focus
groups and surveys with participants to the ENCODE training events.

The shared views resulting from this have informed the design of basic
and advanced teaching modules and of the
[database](https://gn.biblhertz.it/encode/index.html) collecting
teaching materials and examples of training activities, the reports have
also been the basis for the design of the
[MOOC](https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci13010043).

Existing surveys on subject specific and transversal competences as well
as shared reference points at European level on expected learning
outcomes do usually focus on the level of programmes and areas of study,
while in this case we produced a specific report to be used within
innovative and compact transnational training activities targeted at
bridging the gap between very specific and specialistic humanistic
training and emerging new areas of competence in the Digital Humanities
and in the field of Artificial Intelligence. While research exists which
details the necessity or the structure of training in this area
([Bodard and Stoyanova 2016](http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/bat),
[Parker et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1163/9789004399297_011)),
no systematic report exists which crosses several national contexts,
neither one that includes the point of view of students and employees.

In the last years, within the European Area of Higher Education and
within the European Union strategy of LifeLong Learning, a growing
attention has been devoted to competence frameworks and to definition
key competences as a way, on one hand, to facilitate convergence in
Education, on the other hand as a way to ‘support and reinforce the
development of key competences from an early age and throughout life,
for all individuals, as part of national lifelong learning strategies’,
with the awareness that ‘a shared and updated understanding of key
competences is a first step for fostering education, training and
non-formal learning in Europe’. \[COUNCIL RECOMMENDATION of 22 May 2018
on key competences for lifelong learning (2018/C 189/01).

More specifically, we have considered two main Reference Frameworks:

1.  Since we target HE graduates in the Humanities, with a special focus
    for disciplines dealing with ancient written objects, we have
    taken into account the Subject Area Learning Outcomes / Assessment
    Reference Framework in Higher Education for History produced
    within the EU Erasmus+ funded project *Measuring and Comparing
    Achievements of Learning Outcomes in Europe* - **CALOHEE**
    \[[https://www.calohee.eu/](https://www.calohee.eu/)\]

2.  Since we want to improve and bridge specialised knowledge with the
    suitable digital competences needed by new profiles of graduates,
    we have taken into account the **DigComp.** *The Digital
    Competence Framework for Citizens* in its 2.1 and 2.2 version.

    [10.2760/490274 (print)](https://dx.doi.org/10.2760/490274)
    connecting it with more specific reflections arising from pilot
    training carried out by the EpiDoc community (the community of
    scholars active in digital edition of Inscriptions and papyri)
