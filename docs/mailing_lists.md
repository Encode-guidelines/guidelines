**<span class="mark">3.4 Guidelines: Some mailing lists useful for
disciplines related to ancient writing cultures</span>**

-   <span class="mark">The [<u>Markup
    list</u>](https://lsv.uky.edu/archives/markup.html) is a forum for
    discussion of text markup issues and the encoding of ancient
    languages, in EpiDoc. Discussions may concern Guidelines, schema,
    XSLT and other tools produced by the EpiDoc community and involve
    members of projects based on EpiDoc. Other useful tools for
    discussion are the sections [<u>Request
    Features</u>](https://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/feature-requests/)
    and [<u>Report Bugs</u>](https://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/bugs/)
    on the main EpiDoc website on
    [<u>Sourceforge</u>](https://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/wiki/Home/),
    in which members of the Community can request additional features
    or just report problems respectively.</span>

-   <span class="mark">The [<u>GLTreebank mailing
    list</u>](https://groups.google.com/g/gltreebank) is used for the
    discussion of Ancient Greek and Latin treebanking, morphosyntactic
    annotation, querying, visualising, and otherwise using treebanks.
    Members can discuss already existing corpora or the development of
    new projects concerning those topics.</span>

-   <span class="mark">The [<u>D-Scribes
    List</u>](http://lists.d-scribes.org/mailman/listinfo/mailinglist)
    is a mailing list developed from the
    [<u>D-Scribes</u>](https://d-scribes.philhist.unibas.ch/en/)
    project (SNSF Ambizione project "Reuniting fragments, identifying
    scribes and characterising scripts: the Digital paleography of
    Greek and Coptic papyri"). Members discuss writer identification,
    ancient document analysis, computerised classification and
    letter/sign shape comparison in the field of digital papyrology
    and palaeography.</span>

-   <span class="mark">[<u>Pelagios Network
    Members</u>](https://groups.google.com/g/pelagios-network) is the
    mailing list of the members of the [<u>Pelagios
    network</u>](https://pelagios.org/). The project aims at
    connecting researchers, scientists and curators to link and
    explore the history of places. The aim of the project is to
    develop a method for creating semantic annotations and tools for
    creating and making use of these annotations (the
    [<u>Recogito</u>](https://recogito.pelagios.org/) platform). To do
    so, it is essential to create a community of individuals and
    organisations working with geographic data in humanities
    disciplines and cultural heritage: besides a smaller group of
    partners who actively collaborate in the activities of the
    community, there is a larger group of members who have an interest
    on the projectâ€™s outputs and want to discuss specific problems or
    request features and who can freely register to the mailing
    list.</span>
