### Markup List 
The [Markup List](https://lsv.uky.edu/archives/markup.html) is a forum for discussion of text markup issues and the encoding of ancient
 languages, in EpiDoc. Discussions may concern Guidelines, schema,
 XSLT and other tools produced by the EpiDoc community and involve
members of projects based on EpiDoc. Other useful tools for discussion are the sections 
[Request Features](https://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/feature-requests/) and
 [Report Bugs](https://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/bugs/) on the main EpiDoc website on
  [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/wiki/Home/), in which members of the Community can request additional features 
  or just report problems respectively.  

### GLTreebank mailing list 
The [GLTreebank mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/gltreebank) 
is used for the discussion of Ancient Greek and Latin treebanking, morphosyntactic
annotation, querying, visualising, and otherwise using treebanks.
Members can discuss already existing corpora or the development of
new projects concerning those topics.  

### D-Scribes List  
 The [D-Scribes List](http://lists.d-scribes.org/mailman/listinfo/mailinglist) is a mailing list developed from the
 [D-Scribes](https://d-scribes.philhist.unibas.ch/en/) project (SNSF Ambizione project "Reuniting fragments, identifying
 scribes and characterising scripts: the Digital paleography of Greek and Coptic papyri"). Members discuss writer identification,
 ancient document analysis, computerised classification and letter/sign shape comparison in the field of digital papyrology
 and palaeography.  

### Pelagios Network Members  
[Pelagios Network
Members](https://groups.google.com/g/pelagios-network) is the mailing list of the members of the [Pelagios
network](https://pelagios.org/). The project aims at connecting researchers, scientists and curators to link and
explore the history of places. The aim of the project is to develop a method for creating semantic annotations and tools for
creating and making use of these annotations (the[Recogito](https://recogito.pelagios.org/) platform). To do
so, it is essential to create a community of individuals and organisations working with geographic data in humanities
disciplines and cultural heritage: besides a smaller group of
partners who actively collaborate in the activities of the
community, there is a larger group of members who have an interest
on the projectâ€™s outputs and want to discuss specific problems or
request features and who can freely register to the mailing
list.
