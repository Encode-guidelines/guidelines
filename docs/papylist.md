The
[PAPY-list](https://lists.ku.dk/postorius/lists/papy.lists.hum.ku.dk/)
is a mailing list that has been serving papyrologists since its
establishment in 1993. While primarily beneficial for Greek and Latin
papyrologists, it also welcomes contributions from demotists,
coptologists, and Arabic papyrologists. The list generally operates
without moderation, allowing messages and their replies to be
distributed to all subscribers. On average, there are approximately 25
conversations per month.

The main purpose of the PAPY discussion list is to facilitate occasional
information exchange and discussions on topics relevant to papyrologists
(including Greek, Latin, Coptic, and Demotic) and ancient historians
with an interest in Greco-Roman Egypt. A significant aspect of the list
is to provide a platform for authors to share their new publications,
often presenting them personally. However, formal reviews are not
provided. While English, French, German, and Italian are frequently
used, there is no official language requirement for participation.

Since its inception, the list has become a valuable resource for
scholars in the field, facilitating the sharing of knowledge and the
advancement of papyrological research. It continues to be an active and
influential platform within the field of papyrology, connecting
researchers and serving as a hub for scholarly discourse on topics
related to ancient papyrus texts.
