# BærUt! – Bærekraftige Digitale Utgaver | Sustainable Digital Scholarly Editions

## Name

*credit Federico Aurora*

**BærUt!**

Å bære ut = bringe, fordele (post, aviser e.l.) til mottagere

I.e. målet er å bære ut utgavene til brukerne

English = deliver, deliver sth. to sb.

## Description (long)

*translated from Norwegian w/ gpt.uio.no, to be reviewed by AR*

### Humanities Data: Multi-disciplinary, Multilingual, Semi-structured, Costly and Crucial

A very large proportion of 'data' being created and made accessible in the diverse and multilingual humanities disciplines (history, cultural history, art history, philosophy and intellectual history, literary studies, music history, language and area studies, theology, etc.) is in text form and is created in semi-structured formats (such as XML, but also plain text in relational and graph databases). International standards for markup, coding, and metadata are used, and the results are called digital scholarly editions (DSE). A lot of time, resources, and scholarly expertise are invested in obtaining reliable, well-documented, intersubjectively-verifiable representations of historical and cultural heritage material in these DVUs, which are then used by researchers and students, schools and educational institutions, the cultural sector, and society at large for a long time.

- humanities data is often text, and often in semi-structured formats
- there are standards for markup/coding/metadata, but they are not widely known/discipline specific
- a lot of resources are invested in creating DSEs
- they are aimed to be used widely accross academic, cultural heritage, educational and cultural institutions and society at large

### Problem: Retention and Sharing of Skills and Knowledge, Technical and Philological Maintenance of DSEs

At least, that is the idea behind the projects. However, since there are no established national or international solutions, almost all projects that create DVUs must find their own solutions for long-term archiving of data, systems, and user interfaces, for data accessibility and for different user groups, and for the operation of systems and especially user interfaces. Even though the data is mostly interoperable, the systems and user interfaces are not. This situation means that today it is not possible to guarantee access to and reuse of humanities data after the project is completed. Researchers, institutes, and cultural heritage institutions end up with valuable and precious data in outdated, unusable, or legacy systems. This is a significant loss, as the material is often of interest not only to other disciplines but also to international research: many humanities projects at UiO focus on editions of material written in languages other than Norwegian, which are part of the cultural heritage of other countries and cultures, such as Coptic, Ancient Greek, Latin, Early Modern German, Italian, etc. Neither the National Library nor the National Archives have the mandate to preserve and make such material accessible. In addition, DVUs are often the product of small academic communities - even though they are also part of larger international communities - with little transfer and continuity of expertise and resources when projects end. BærUt! Hub/Node will contribute to making the expertise, IT resources, and solutions for humanities data in the form of DVUs and its specific archiving challenges accessible and sustainable for researchers and cultural heritage institutions. The ambition is to create expertise in and knowledge about DVUs and develop a foundation for a national shared solution.

- in Norway, no national or international solutions for long-term archiving of data, systems and user interfaces, for data accessibility, for operation of system
- cannot guarantee access to and reuse of humanities data after project end
- valuale and precious data in outdated, unusable or legacy systems with no one to host, maintain and further develop
- at UiO, non-Norwegian/Scandinavian materials will not be systematically indexed, archived, or kept accessible by large cultural heritage institutions like National Libary or National Archives


### Transdisciplinarity as a Solution

One challenge has been the lack of coordination of interdisciplinary editorial philological research, data production, and insufficient information technology and data management infrastructures at UiO and other Norwegian academic and cultural heritage institutions. This is due, not least, to the fact that researchers who create digital editions usually have a disciplinary background in, for example, Greek or Nordic philology, and do not encounter each other even though they use the same technology and struggle with the same problems. This reduces the chance for knowledge transfer and interdisciplinary cooperation.

- challenges with transfer of skills and knowledge between projects/disciplines/Depts.

### University Library as a Key Player

Therefore, BærUt! Hub/Node should be placed in a strong editorial philological research environment at a unit that has long-term preservation, accessibility, and curation of cultural heritage in the form of material and digital documents as its main responsibility: the University Library.

Our portfolio includes collection, curation, long-term archiving, and accessibility of national and international cultural heritage, from history to the present, particularly in textual form and in various languages, both physical and digital. Moreover, the University Library is a leading institution in the use and further development of metadata standards for describing humanities data, especially in information science and humanities disciplines. We also have several researchers with expertise in the design and communication of digital scholarly editions and editorial philology in theory and practice, and can provide a platform where researchers from different disciplines can meet, share experiences, and expand their own expertise.

- expertise in long-term preservation, accessiblity, curation of cutlural heritage material
- strong focus on data management and FAIR
- longer term strategy
- permanent hires
- system admins, developers and digtial research methods experts
- Digital Scholarship Center
- physical meeting place
- training and teaching
