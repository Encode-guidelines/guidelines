## About Papyri.info

The [Papyri.info ](http://www.papyri.info/) portal is the
most comprehensive resource for accessing and studying ancient papyrus
texts. Its primary goal is to bring together various collections of
papyrus texts and make them accessible to researchers worldwide. The
collection comprises transcriptions that are encoded using EpiDoc, a
specialized XML schema derived from TEI (Text Encoding Initiative)
specifically designed for representing ancient inscriptions and papyrus
documents.

The content of the platform, which includes the text of the papyri and
their associated metadata, primarily comes from the aggregation of
existing databases. Papyri.info aggregates material from the [Advanced
Papyrological Information System
(APIS)](https://papyri.info/docs/apis), [Duke Databank of
Documentary
Papyri](http://papyri.info/ddbdp) (DDbDP), [Heidelberger
Gesamtverzeichnis der griechischen Papyrusurkunden
Ägyptens (HGV)](https://aquila.zaw.uni-heidelberg.de/start), [Bibliographie
Papyrologique (BP)](http://www.aere-egke.be/BP/), and
depends on close collaboration
with [Trismegistos](http://www.trismegistos.org/), for
rigorous maintenance of relationship mapping and unique identifiers.
 Work is in progress to incorporate content from the [Arabic
Papyrological
Database (APD)](https://www.apd.gwi.uni-muenchen.de/apd/project.jsp)
as well.

However, user contributions also play a significant role. Individuals
have the opportunity to register, submit new texts and metadata, and
edit existing entries. These submissions undergo an editorial vetting
process to ensure adherence to scholarly standards.

## Papyri.info's Structure

The platform is structured into two main sections: the Papyrological
Navigator and the Papyrological Editor.

All of the content is openly accessible through the [Papyrological
Navigator](https://papyri.info/search), a navigable and
searchable section that is the user interface of the database where
encoded texts are stored. The platform offers advanced search
capabilities, allowing users to search for specific papyrus texts based
on criteria such as keywords, authors, dates, and locations. Users can
conduct text searches throughout the database, allowing for research
into parallel texts and contextual data. The Papyrological Navigator
incorporates the [Checklist of
Editions](https://papyri.info/docs/checklist), which serves
as a comprehensive inventory of papyrological editions and tools. This
checklist also functions as a reference for standard abbreviations
commonly employed in the field.

Additionally, Papyri.info supports editing and contributions from the
scholarly community through the [Papyrological
Editor](http://papyri.info/editor), the implementation of
the [SoSOL](https://github.com/sosol/sosol) editing and
workflow management tool created by the Integrating Digital Papyrology
project. Scholars can submit corrections, transcriptions, translations,
and annotations to enhance the accuracy and completeness of the
available texts. Encoding on the platform is collaborative: qualified
users can
[register](https://papyri.info/editor/user/signin) and
contribute to edit documents, submit documents for publication, publish
new documents and collaborate with other users. A committee of experts
evaluates all submissions before publication.

Editing is made accessible to scholars that are unfamiliar with mark-up
languages thanks to the implementation of Leiden+, a tag-lite system
that closely resembles the Leiden conventions and is automatically
converted into XML, for reusability purposes, through the XSugar
routine.

The XML schema used for Papyri.info is the one defined by the
[EpiDoc](https://epidoc.stoa.org/gl/latest/intro-intro.html)
project for encoding ancient epigraphs, which in turn is based on the
[Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)](https://tei-c.org/)
guidelines that define the XML standard for representing texts in
digital format.
