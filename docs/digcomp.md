This framework addresses digital transformation and is aimed at
providing a shared definition of digital competences. DigComp, as the
EU-wide framework for developing and measuring digital competences in
March 2022, has been published in its 2.2 version, which takes into
account developments in the field of AI as well. DigComp 2.2, is
considered a wider reference framework for citizensâ€™ competences and
does not target specific levels of Education, but nevertheless provides
a useful basis for educational innovation, taking into account the
labour market and societal changes.

The DigComp conceptual model is based on a matrix of five dimensions
(information and data literacy; communication and collaboration; digital
content creation; safety; problem-solving) with four progressive overall
levels (foundation, intermediate, advanced, and highly specialised),
articulated in eight granular levels. This matrix is independent of
qualifications, and levels are built on three main areas of mastery: (1)
complexity of tasks, (2) autonomy, and (3) cognitive domain
(remembering, understanding, applying, evaluating, and creating).

For our purposes we have focused mainly on the areas of Competence 1:
Information and data literacy (level 5 to 6), 2: Communication and
collaboration (level 4 to 6), 3: Digital content creation (level 4 to
6), 5: Problem solving (level 4 to 5)

For some training we have also included area 4: Safety at level 3.

The Learning outcomes which we used to plan our trainings as well as the
competences which were required or achieved are listed in the detailed
documents of the training events:
