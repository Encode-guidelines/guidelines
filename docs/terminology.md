**3D Modelling/3D Imaging**: 3D modelling is the production of a 3D reconstruction of a lost, damaged or conjectured object or structure via specialized software. The difference with 3D imaging
 is that this one technologically captures an existing object via scanning, photographing, or otherwise accurately capturing the surface, geometry or volume of the original object.

**Authority list**: an authority list is a controlled vocabulary you can create if you want to save repeatable information, enforcing consistency within your corpus/database.
 You may want to generate authority lists about persons, places, institutions, and so on within your corpus/database or to refer to external authority lists
  (such as Pleiades, LGPN, EAGLE Vocabularies…).

**Command line**: or command-line interface (CLI) is is a means of interacting with a device or computer program with commands from a user or client, and responses 
from the device or program, in the form of lines of text

**cURL**: or client URL is a command line tool for file transfer with a URL syntax. It supports a number of protocols including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and many more. It is also used for interacting with APIs

**CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete)**: is a computer software project providing a library (libcurl) and command-line tool (curl) for transferring data using various network protocols. The name stands for "Client for URL".[8]

**Digital vs. digitized editions**: while a digitized edition is a simple representation of a paper edition in a digital means, a digital edition cannot be given in print without a significant loss of content. It typically comprises advanced search functionalities, 
different data visualization modes and links to document images.

**DOI Digital Object Identifier**: DOI (Digital Object Identifier) is a string of numbers, letters and symbols used to permanently identify an article or document and link to it on the web. A DOI helps a reader to easily locate a document from a citation.

**EpiDoc**: EpiDoc is the leading standard for the digital encoding of ancient sources (mainly inscriptions, papyri and other primary and documentary texts). EpiDoc is a subset of TEI and a
 customization of it narrowed to specific documents through which you can highlight specific textual features and index them semi-automatically or automatically.

**FAIR**: FAIR is a set of principles published in 2016 in Scientific Data, which recommends the behaviour to which we are expected to conform when publishing data online. It is an acronym for 
Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reuse.

**Fork**:  "to fork" means to copy a piece of code from a software and start to develop a new version of it.

**GIS**: GIS is the acronym of Geographic Information System, a system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and visualize spatial or geographic data, enabling queries,
 data analysis and their representation in maps.

*GUI*:  a Graphic User Interface is an infrastructure (typically a desktop application or a website) that allows users to interact (search and query) a database in a way that 
is relatively intuitive and to this end makes use of graphical elements such as buttons, icons, images, graphs, etc. (hence “graphical”).

**Interface**:  an interface is a tool that enables two parts of  a computer system to communicate. This includes the communicatio between a human user and  a computer (see also GUI above).

**LOD**: LOD, an acronym for Linked Open Data, is structured data which is interlinked with other data and is the basis of the Semantic Web, as conceived by Tim Berners-Lee, who coined the term in a 2006.r

**Ontology**:  a system of concepts (e.g. inscription), properties (e.g. damaged), categories (e.g.  a given inscription collection), and relations (e.g. "belonging to a given collection" or "being damaged") 
used to formally describe a given subject are (e.g. epigraphy, Roman literature). Every "thing" that we want to formally describe, for example in  database will be assigned to one of these classes.


**Populate**: enter data into a database.

**Programming language**: a formal language, usually text based, for writing computer programs.

**Relational Database**: Relational Database is a way to store data in tables, according to the relational model which represents data as entities, attributes, and relationships between entities and attributes or relationships between two entities.

**Semantic markup**: the semantic markup encodes structural and semantic features of a text. An example of semantic markup is XML. The opposite of semantic markup is renditional markup, which describes the structural and graphic features of a text.

**SPARQL**: SPARQL (short for 'SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language') is a standard designed and endorsed by the W3C and enables users to query information from databases or any data source that can be mapped to RDF.

**Static vs. Dynamic website**: is a website is entirely precompiled and stored as HTML files. A static website has limited search possibilities, basically limited to text searches. A dynamic website is more interactive,
and the content shown can be changed by the user, typically interacting with a database from which data are extracted through queries and shown as query results on the website. The structure of a dynamic website
usually comprises, in addition to HTML files, also various other file types, written in different programming languages: CSS files, used to describe the presentation, i.e.,  the appearance of a web page,
JavaScript files, used to make web pages interactive; PHP, Python or XSLT (in the case of XML databases) used to connect the web page to the database.

**TEI**: TEI is an acronym for Text Encoding Initiative, a standard used to encode historical and literary documents in XML.

**URI**: URI is an acronym for Uniform Resource Identifier. It is is a unique identifier for an abstract or physical resource that is, oftentimes, connected to the internet and helps users distinguish resources such as electronic documents, webpages, and information sources, from another. URIs execute internet protocols to allow users to interact with such resources. The most common form of a URI is a URL, which is commonly known as a web address.

**URL**: URL is an acronym for Uniform Resource Locator. It is a reference or address used to locate resources such as web pages, files, or other online content. It typically consists of a protocol identifier (_e.g._, http or https), a domain name, and a specific path to the resource.

**Versioning**: assign unique identifiers (names, numbers) to different versions of a piece of code or a software in order to keep track of the changes (and the authors of the changes). 
This obviously allows to go back to a previous version of the code.

**Written Artefacts**: «As for written artefacts we take the broad working definition of any artificial or natural object that have written or pictorial (visual) signs. This definition includes the traditional notion of manuscript, in all attested book forms, and inscription, and at the same time goes well beyond these broad categories» (Cluster of Excellence ‘Understanding Written Artefacts’ Universität Hamburg). 

**XML**: XML is an acronym for eXtensible Markup Language. XML is a markup that allows the structured encoding of text or data in human- and machine-readable format.

**XML Database**: XML Database is a way to store data in a document-oriented approach since the information regarding a given document is entered and stored in a single file encoded in the XML markup language.
