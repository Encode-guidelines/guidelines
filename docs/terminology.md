**3D Modelling/3D Imaging**: 3D modelling is the production of a 3D reconstruction of a lost, damaged or conjectured object or structure via specialized software. The difference with 3D imaging is that this one technologically captures an existing object via scanning, photographing, or otherwise accurately capturing the surface, geometry or volume of the original object.

**Authority list**: an authority list is a controlled vocabulary you can create if you want to save repeatable information, enforcing consistency within your corpus/database. You may want to generate authority lists about persons, places, institutions, and so on within your corpus/database or to refer to external authority lists (such as Pleiades, LGPN, EAGLE Vocabularies…).

**Command line**:

**CURL**:

**CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete)**

is a computer software project providing a library (libcurl) and command-line tool (curl) for transferring data using various network protocols. The name stands for "Client for URL".[8]

**Digital vs. digitized editions**:

**DOI Digital Object Identifier**:

**EpiDoc**: EpiDoc is the leading standard for the digital encoding of ancient sources (mainly inscriptions, papyri and other primary and documentary texts). EpiDoc is a subset of TEI and a customization of it narrowed to specific documents through which you can highlight specific textual features and index them semi-automatically or automatically.

**FAIR**: FAIR is a set of principles published in 2016 in Scientific Data, which recommends the behaviour to which we are expected to conform when publishing data online. It is an acronym for Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reuse.

**Fork**:

**GIS**: GIS is the acronym of Geographic Information System, a system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and visualize spatial or geographic data, enabling queries, data analysis and their representation in maps.

**Interface**:

**LOD**: LOD, an acronym for Linked Open Data, is structured data which is interlinked with other data and is the basis of the Semantic Web, as conceived by Tim Berners-Lee, who coined the term in a 2006.

**Ontology**:

**Populate**:

**Programming language**:

**Relational Database**: Relational Database is a way to store data in tables, according to the relational model which represents data as entities, attributes, and relationships between entities and attributes or relationships between two entities.

**Semantic markup**: the semantic markup encodes structural and semantic features of a text. An example of semantic markup is XML. The opposite of semantic markup is renditional markup, which describes the structural and graphic features of a text.

**Sparql**:

**Static vs.dynamic website**:

**TEI**: TEI is an acronym for Text Encoding Initiative, a standard used to encode historical and literary documents in XML.

**URI**:

**URL**: URL is an acronym for Uniform Resource Locator. It is a reference or address used to locate resources such as web pages, files, or other online content. It typically consists of a protocol identifier (_e.g._, http or https), a domain name, and a specific path to the resource.

**Versioning**:

**Written Artefacts**: «As for written artefacts we take the broad working definition of any artificial or natural object that have written or pictorial (visual) signs. This definition includes the traditional notion of manuscript, in all attested book forms, and inscription, and at the same time goes well beyond these broad categories» (Cluster of Excellence ‘Understanding Written Artefacts’ Universität Hamburg). 

**XML**: XML is an acronym for eXtensible Markup Language. XML is a markup that allows the structured encoding of text or data in human- and machine-readable format.

**XML Database**: XML Database is a way to store data in a document-oriented approach since the information regarding a given document is entered and stored in a single file encoded in the XML markup language.
