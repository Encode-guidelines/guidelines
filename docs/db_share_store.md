## Storing & Sharing

Databases can of course be stored on a private computer. This is, however, not the best solution from the  sustainability point of view.
In order to comply with [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), according to which scientific data should be
 *findable*, *accessible*, *interoperable* and *reproducible* a database should be stored in an open access repository, together with a
  description of its content and structure. Further, its content should ideally be downloadable in different file format.

In addition to national or institutional repositories, these are frequently used by researchers in the Humanities:

- [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)  
CERN

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)  
owned by Microsoft, but free and accessible
  
Different  [types of database](/db_creation/) 
(see also [Unit 3 of the ENCODE Online Course](https://teach-dariah-cur.acdh-dev.oeaw.ac.at/mod/lesson/view.php?id=2503)) can be exported 
and stored in different file format.

- MySQL

- CSV

- XML

## Publishing

Think of the storing sharing and publishing already in the planning phase
